Debug firmware with ease;
Connect a standard JTAG and SWD debugger to the Crazyflie 2.0.
%}

One of our goals is to make development with the Crazyflie 2.0 as easy
as possible. But due to the platforms small size there are limitations
in what connectors we can have. Therefore we designed a debug-adapter
kit that makes connecting a debugger to either of the MCUs a lot
easier, by converting the connector pinouts to standard JTAG and SWD
pinouts.
