{% gs_intro Expansion decks %}
The Crazyflie 2.0 is equipped with a flexible expansion port that enables new 
hardware to be connected. The port is available from both sides of the Crazyflie 
to keep as many options open as possible. The port is used by expansion decks 
to provide new functionality to the Crazyflie 2.0 and since the port is 
available from both sides it is possible to attach two decks at the same time.

{% gs_step attaching a deck %}
**BE AWARE** that it is very important to mount an expansion deck with the 
**CORRECT ORIENTATION**, or the deck might be damaged. Always make sure the 
Crazyflie 2.0 is powered off before mounting or unmounting a deck.

Look for the small symbols that show which side is up and down, the dot is up and the cross is down.
The arrow indicates the forward direction and should point towards the front.

Decks that are mounted on top of the Crazyflie 2.0 replace the battery holder.
