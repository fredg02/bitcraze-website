## What can you develop?

The Crazyflie platform is much more than just a quadcopter. It consists of lots 
of different parts working together to complete the system. That means that 
developers can dive into any given area and experiment, learn and improve. Each 
of these areas can be explored separately using other boards, but with the 
Crazyflie you have a complete system built around what you are experimenting 
with. Here’s examples of a  few areas that you can explore:

* **Sensors:** The platform consists of a number of different sensors. All of 
these need signal processing and tuning to optimize performance.
* **Sensor fusion:** The outputs from all the sensors are fused together to 
create the best possible measurement of the platform orientation.
* **Control theory:** The platform consists of a number of different 
control-loops. Both for controlling roll/pitch/yaw onboard the Crazyflie, but 
also for controlling the platform if you use external equipment like a Kinect to 
fly [see our blog](/blog/).
* **Radio protocols:** The Crazyflie communicates via radio with the host. The 
protocol is very basic but has the potential to be expanded with more features.
* **USB:** The Crazyradio uses USB device to communication with the host
Real-time systems: The Crazyflie firmware is very time critical.
* **Image processing:** When using for instance the Kinect to fly you need image 
processing to detect and calculate where the Crazyflie is.
* **Android:** Using your USB OTH/HOST enabled Android device you can use the 
Crazyradio to fly your Crazyflie.

The different systems use different languages. So if you are looking at using a 
specific language there are a few to choose from:

* C for the Crazyradio and Crazyflie firmware
* Python for the Crazyflie PC API and client (the also have Ruby and C/C++ APIs 
maintained by the community)
* Java for the Crazyflie Android Client

## Tools

Even though we detail how to set up the different development environments for 
the Crazyflie platform, this can be a hassle. To make it as easy as possible 
for developers to start developing we provide a virtual machine that contains 
everything needed. All you need is the virtual machine handler of your choice 
then download and import the virtual machine that we have prepared. Since the 
platform is developed using only open tools you will have access to everything 
you need for development. This includes build-systems, compilers, EDA software, 
firmware libraries and debugging tools.

Using the virtual machine you will be able to:

* View, build and debug the Crazyflie firmware
* View and build the Crazyradio firmware
* View the EDA projects for the Crazyflie and the Crazyradio
* Develop the PC host applications
* Fly the Crazyflie of course :-)

## Features

Since the Crazyflie platform was intended to be used for experiments and 
development, we wanted to put in some features that made this easier. Debugging 
and developing for a flying platform isn’t always easy. Here are some of the 
features:

* Bootload firmware via the radio
* Parameter framework for editing and reading data via the radio
* Logging framework for logging data via the radio
* Lots of CPU cycles left over as well as flash and RAM free to use
* JTAG interface
* Expansion interface to attach new hardware

The radio bootloader enables downloading and flashing firmware to the Crazyflie 
via the radio. This means that when you are developing there’s no need to plug 
it to the USB or a JTAG to flash your fresh builds. There’s also a USB 
bootloader on the Crazyradio dongle that enables updating of firmware without 
any external equipment.

The parameter and logging frameworks enables developers to easily (via macros 
in the firmware) define a special usage for variables. When the host connects 
to the Crazyflie a list of these are downloaded and they can be used. The 
parameters are used to change variables in the Crazyflie in real-time. This is 
very useful when working with the regulation, then you can change the tuning on 
the fly. The logging framework is used to set up logging of variables from the 
Crazyflie. Once set up the Crazyflie will push the values to the host at a 
specified time interval. The values can then either be shown in the GUI, 
plotted or saved to a file for external processing.

The Crazyflie features an ARM Cortex-M3 micro controller running at 72MHz and 
with 20kb of RAM and 128kb of flash. This is a power chip and even with our 
firmware running on it there’s lots of resources left over for developers to 
use. 

On the side of the Crazyflie there’s an expansion header. This header doesn’t 
only contain the JTAG, it also contains a number of buses and power, providing 
the possibility to extend the platform with new hardware. For more information 
on the expansion header have a look at our [Wiki](//wiki.bitcraze.io).

## Community

All our projects are open and are hosted over at GitHub. This is also the place 
where you can suggest new features, report issues and find current issues that 
needs fixing. Apart from this we also host a wiki and an active forum. The wiki 
contains documentation of our platform, guides on how to develop and use it as 
well as documentation of different experiments and hacks that we and other have 
done.

The forum is used to get support, discuss our platform or just show off some 
project that they have done. If you feel like contributing we accept 
pull-requests for all our software/firmware (after review and testing) and also 
let users get write access to our wiki. This is a great resource for us since 
there’s lot’s of things we miss and need help fixing.
