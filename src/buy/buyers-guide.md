## I just want to fly the Crazyflie 2.0, what do I need to get?

The Crazyflie 2.0 comes with everything you need for flying from a Bluetooth LE 
enabled mobile device. You can also get the separately sold Crazyradio PA for 
connecting to the computer and using a gamepad.

## I want to use the Crazyflie 2.0 for development, what do I need to get?

When doing development for the Crazyflie 2.0 using the Crazyradio PA USB dongle 
is a good idea. This enables you to make use of the APIs for the computer which 
contains our logging and parameter framework that makes development a lot 
easier. If you are planning on doing lots of firmware development, then itâ€™s 
always a good idea to get JTAG/SWD access to the platform for debugging. With 
our debug adapter kit you can connect your normal JTAG/SWD debugger easily.
